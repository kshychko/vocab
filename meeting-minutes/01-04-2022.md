# Discussions

We picked up the discussions about semantic issues, Marek will also raise this internally in UNECE and about how to deprecate where overlap exists.
related to https://github.com/uncefact/vocab/issues/72 and https://github.com/uncefact/vocab/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asemantics

We should consider https://github.com/uncefact/vocab/issues/23 and using equivilence where possible to relate to other vocabs i.e. schema.org, geoSPARQL.  WE shouldn't be opinionated or challenge other vocabs which are in use,, just identify that the yshould be considered and aare equivilent.

https://github.com/uncefact/vocab/issues/37 will be actioned by Kseniya to remove the prefix which is part of the namespace.

QUDT appear to have added references to our vocab following discussions, now contains all UN recommended codes for measurement units.  See https://github.com/uncefact/vocab/issues/32 for details and its already in the QUDT public release! Wow this is amazing :)  Nis to share the link when available.
